    <h1 class="text-light">A bit about us</h1><br>

    <p class="text-light">ECO was founded in 1971 as CoEnCo to meet the needs of the conservation community. We became ECO in 1976. We are a non-profit network of 50+ organisations with a concern for conservation and the environment.
<br><br>
Our membership includes large international groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, national groups including National Council of Women, as well as small local groups such as Kapiti Environmental Action and Save the Otago Peninsula, and issue oriented groups like the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust.
<br><br>
ECO has been centrally involved in campaigns to protect native forests, lakes and rivers, the reform of the Mining Act and defeat of the National Development Act, and in supporting the Resource Management Act and the establishment of the Department of Conservation and Ministry for the Environment. ECO continues to be at the forefront of environmental campaigns on fisheries, transport and environmental management.
<br><br>
ECO's work is carried out largely by volunteers, supported by a small office and resource centre in Wellington. There are around 500 "Friends of ECO," individual subscribers and others who support our work.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light">What we do</h1><br>

    <p class="text-light">ECO - New Zealand’s national network working to protect our environment. <br><br>

    ECO works to protect New Zealand’s unique natural heritage and to foster the relationship New Zealanders have with it. The natural environment is central to our culture, economy and identity. ECO acts to protect it for recreation, for its intrinsic quality and for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. <br><br>

    We strive to empower and inform people to work for better management and protection of New Zealand’s forests, coasts, sea, rivers, land, atmosphere and our unique species. <br><br>

    ECO is a network of fifty-plus large and small environmental organisations based all around New Zealand, as well as several hundred individual Friends. The core of ECO’s work is promoting and strengthening community environmental action, and working collaboratively towards better government policies and management decisions. ECO also works on global issues such as climate change, Antarctica, and oceans.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light">History of ECO</h1><br>

    <p class="text-light">ECO has had a long history of engagement on a wide range of environment and conservation issues.
    <br><br>
    Following the 'Save Manapouri campaign’ there was a feeling among many conservation groups of the need for some form of federation that could express a unified opinion. A decision by about 40 groups was made to establish ECO towards the end of 1971 as CoEnCo (NZ Conference on Environment and Conservation) to meet the needs of the conservation community and incorporated in 1972.  The founding Chair of CoEnCO was John Salmon.
    <br><br>
    CoEnCo became ECO in 1976.

    Throughout its history ECO's work has been mainly carried out largely by volunteers, supported by a small office and resource centre in Wellington. There are several hundred "Friends of ECO," individual subscribers who support our work.
    <br><br>
    “Friends of ECO” was an initiative of a former Chair, Ian Prior, in the late 1970s to assist ECO in its work.
    ECO membership has been broader than environmental groups and includes groups with a concern for the environment and conservation.</p>
